Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
------ They are a financial institution requesting a web-application that allows for secure transactions for clients.
What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
------- Thinking of the overall security. Not only just on the software side but how the application can be managed for better security.
What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
-----------Implementing the suppressions in the Maven report. I ran into a lot of different errors.
How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
----------- Two Factor Authentication, secure certificates, and others were some of the strategies for securing the application. You can also improve web security for individual users to assist as well.
How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
------------- Running the Maven report is a good way to see the different vulnerabilities. 
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
------------ I used many resources from personal knowledge to github and others. There are many resources out there, you just have to search for them.
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
------------ Yeah, I think so. If the job requires looking at security then I definitely would. It shows that I take security into account when developing.
